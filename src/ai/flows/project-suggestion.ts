/**
 * @fileOverview AI-powered project suggestion flow.
 *
 * This file defines a Genkit flow that evaluates user navigation patterns
 * and suggests the next most relevant project in the portfolio.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Usage in a Next.js component:
 * import { suggestNextProject } from '@/ai/flows/project-suggestion';
 *
 * async function MyComponent() {
 *   const projectId = 'some-project-id';
 *   const allProjects = [{id: 'proj1', title: 'Project 1'}, {id: 'proj2', title: 'Project 2'}];
 *   const nextProjectSuggestion = await suggestNextProject({ currentProjectId: projectId, allProjects });
 *   return <div>Next project suggestion: {nextProjectSuggestion.projectId}</div>;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @requires genkit

  Here is a list of all available projects you can choose from:
  {{#each allProjects}}
  - ID: {{this.id}}, Title: {{this.title}}
  {{/each}}

  The user is currently viewing project with ID: {{{currentProjectId}}}.

  Here's a list of projects the user has viewed previously:
  {{#if userHistory}}
    {{#each userHistory}}
      - {{{this}}}
    {{/each}}
  {{else}}
    The user has no browsing history.
  {{/if}}

  Suggest the next project the user should view, and explain your reasoning.
  You MUST choose a project ID from the provided list of available projects.
  Be creative in the suggestion, avoid suggesting the same project twice in a row.
  Do not suggest the current project with ID {{{currentProjectId}}}.
  Take into account the projects the user has already viewed.
