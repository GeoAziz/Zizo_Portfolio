/**
 * @fileOverview AI-powered project suggestion flow.
 *
 * This file defines a Genkit flow that evaluates user navigation patterns
 * and suggests the next most relevant project in the portfolio.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Usage in a Next.js component:
 * import { suggestNextProject } from '@/ai/flows/project-suggestion';
 *
 * async function MyComponent() {
 *   const projectId = 'some-project-id';
 *   const nextProjectSuggestion = await suggestNextProject({ currentProjectId: projectId });
 *   return <div>Next project suggestion: {nextProjectSuggestion.projectId}</div>;
 * }
 * ```

 * @requires genkit

  The user is currently viewing project with ID: {{{currentProjectId}}}.

  Here's a list of projects the user has viewed previously:
  {{#if userHistory}}
    {{#each userHistory}}
      - {{{this}}}

  {{else}}

  {{/if}}

  Suggest the next project the user should view, and explain your reasoning.
  Ensure that the project ID in the response is valid.
  Be creative in the suggestion, avoid suggesting the same project twice in a row.
  Do not suggest the current project.
  Take into account the projects the user has already viewed.
